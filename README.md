<h5> About the Lab (Objective) : </h5>

To be able to write the assembly language programs of 8085 microprocessor for various applications and observe it's execution through simulation.

<h5> About the Experiment : </h5>

Two 8 bit numbers are given in two registers eg Accumulator (A) and B register. Write the instructions to move the data in these registers, clear the Carry flag and add the contents of these two registers without carry, store the 8 bit result in another register C. Check the contents of C register for result
